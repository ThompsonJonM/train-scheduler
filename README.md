READ FROM BOTTOM TO TOP

LOGIC.JS: Began writing variables for submit function.

INDEX.HTML: Added train number input and reset button. I figure adding a train number allows the app to look a little more realistic as trains are searchable by individual ID #'s.

STYLE.CSS: Styling done.

INDEX.HTML: Changed the header container from normal columns to a jumbotron. This allows the page elements to line up a lot better.
